/**
 * Restora — answer scoring utility.
 *
 * Takes the raw `answers` object from SurveySection state
 * and returns per-dimension scores normalised to 0–100,
 * plus an overall fatigue score.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { scoreAnswers } from './scoreAnswers';
 *   const scores = scoreAnswers(answers); // pass to ResultTeaser
 *
 * Input shape:
 *   { q1: 'often', q2: 'always', q3: 'sometimes', ... }
 *
 * Output shape:
 *   {
 *     dimensions: {
 *       attention_fragmentation: 75,   // 0–100
 *       working_memory: 50,
 *       decision_fatigue: 62,
 *       dopamine_dependency: 88,
 *       recovery_quality: 33,
 *     },
 *     overall: 62,                     // weighted average, 0–100
 *     dominantDimension: 'dopamine_dependency',
 *     severity: 'moderate',            // 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high'
